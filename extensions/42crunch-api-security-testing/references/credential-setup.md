# Credential Setup Reference

Follow this procedure to configure credentials used by all 42Crunch skills.
All detection steps run silently — surface output only on failure or user prompts.

Credentials are stored exclusively in `~/.42crunch/conf/env` (macOS/Linux) or
`%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env` (Windows). No project-level `.env` files are
used.

---

## Step 1 — Check for Existing Credentials

Silently check for an existing credentials file:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
grep -E "^(FREEMIUM_TOKEN|API_KEY)=" "$HOME/.42crunch/conf/env" 2>/dev/null
```

```powershell
# Windows
Select-String -Path "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\conf\env" -Pattern "^(FREEMIUM_TOKEN|API_KEY)=" 2>$null
```

**Mode detection from the file:**

- `FREEMIUM_TOKEN` is present → **Freemium mode**
- `API_KEY` starts with `api_` or `ide_` → **Platform mode**

**If a credential is found**, call `AskUserQuestion`:
- **question**: `"Credentials already configured in ~/.42crunch/conf/env — running in <mode> mode. Key: <masked>. Would you like to keep the existing credentials or replace them?"`
- **options**: `["Keep existing credentials", "Replace credentials"]`

Masking rules: `api_••••••••` / `ide_••••••••` for platform tokens (keep
prefix, replace remaining chars); show first 4 characters + `••••••••` for
freemium tokens (e.g. `eyJh••••••••`).

If keeping → **credential setup complete.**
If replacing → continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Determine User Type

Call `AskUserQuestion`:
- **question**: `"Do you have an existing 42Crunch platform account? (Platform accounts log in to a URL like company.42crunch.cloud and use an API key. Freemium is a free personal account that covers full audit and scan functionalities.)"`
- **options**: `["Yes — I have a platform account", "No — I'm using freemium"]`

---

### Path A — Existing User (Platform mode)

Call `AskUserQuestion`:
- **question**: `"Please enter your API Key (it usually starts with api_ or ide_):"`

Wait for input. Then call `AskUserQuestion`:
- **question**: `"Which region hosts your 42Crunch platform? (Your organisation's IT or security team can confirm this — it's also visible in the URL when you log in.)"`
- **options**: `["US — https://us.42crunch.cloud/", "EU — https://eu.42crunch.cloud/", "Other — I'll enter my platform URL manually"]`

- If **US** chosen: `PLATFORM_HOST=https://us.42crunch.cloud`
- If **EU** chosen: `PLATFORM_HOST=https://eu.42crunch.cloud`
- If **Other** chosen: call `AskUserQuestion` — **question**: `"Please enter your platform URL (e.g. https://your-org.42crunch.cloud):"` — store response as `PLATFORM_HOST`. Trim any trailing slashes.

Store values as `API_KEY` and `PLATFORM_HOST`. Continue to Step 3.

---

### Path B — Not an Existing User

Call `AskUserQuestion`:
- **question**: `"Are you a registered 42Crunch Freemium user?"`
- **options**: `["Yes — I have a token", "No — I need to register"]`

#### Path B-1 — Registered Freemium user

Call `AskUserQuestion`:
- **question**: `"Please paste your Freemium Token (it's a long Base64 string from your registration confirmation email):"`

Wait for input. Store value as `FREEMIUM_TOKEN`. Continue to Step 3.

#### Path B-2 — Not registered

Inform the user:
> No problem — getting a free account takes a minute.
>
> 1. Visit **https://42crunch.com/freemium/**.
> 2. Fill in your email address, accept terms and conditions and click Submit.
> 3. Check your inbox for a confirmation email that includes your freemium token.
>
> When you're ready, just say "continue" or "I have my token" and I'll pick up
> exactly where we left off — you won't need to restart setup.

**Stop — do not proceed.** Credential setup is incomplete. Do not write any credentials file.

---

## Step 3 — Write the Credentials File

Create the directory if it does not exist:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
mkdir -p "$HOME/.42crunch/conf"
```

```powershell
# Windows
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\conf" | Out-Null
```

Write the file. Do not quote values. Do not add spaces around `=`.

**Platform mode**

macOS / Linux — write to `~/.42crunch/conf/env`:

```
API_KEY=<value>
PLATFORM_HOST=<value>
```

Windows — write to `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env`:

```
API_KEY=<value>
PLATFORM_HOST=<value>
```

**Freemium mode**

macOS / Linux — write to `~/.42crunch/conf/env`:

```
FREEMIUM_TOKEN=<value>
```

Windows — write to `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env`:

```
FREEMIUM_TOKEN=<value>
```

**Set restrictive permissions (macOS / Linux only):**

```bash
chmod 600 "$HOME/.42crunch/conf/env"
```

Skip on Windows — `APPDATA` is already protected by Windows ACLs.

---

## Step 4 — Verify

Re-read the file and confirm the correct variable is present:

**Platform mode (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
grep "^API_KEY=" "$HOME/.42crunch/conf/env"
```

**Platform mode (Windows):**
```powershell
Select-String -Path "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\conf\env" -Pattern "^API_KEY="
```

**Freemium mode (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
grep "^FREEMIUM_TOKEN=" "$HOME/.42crunch/conf/env"
```

**Freemium mode (Windows):**
```powershell
Select-String -Path "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\conf\env" -Pattern "^FREEMIUM_TOKEN="
```

Display confirmation with the value **masked**:

**Platform mode (macOS / Linux):**
> Credentials saved to `~/.42crunch/conf/env`.
> Mode: **Platform** | Key: `api_••••••••` | Host: `<PLATFORM_HOST>`

**Platform mode (Windows):**
> Credentials saved to `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env`.
> Mode: **Platform** | Key: `api_••••••••` | Host: `<PLATFORM_HOST>`

**Freemium mode (macOS / Linux):**
> Credentials saved to `~/.42crunch/conf/env`.
> Mode: **Freemium** | Token: `<first-4-chars>••••••••`  ← show first 4 chars of the token

**Freemium mode (Windows):**
> Credentials saved to `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env`.
> Mode: **Freemium** | Token: `<first-4-chars>••••••••`  ← show first 4 chars of the token

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| User provides empty API Key | Re-prompt once with: "It looks like the key didn't come through — please paste it again (it usually starts with `api_` or `ide_`). If you're not sure where to find it, check the 42Crunch platform under **Settings → API Keys**." If still empty, stop with: "I wasn't able to capture your API key. Your binary is installed and working — when you're ready, run `42crunch-setup` again to finish credential setup." |
| User provides empty Platform URL (Other) | Re-prompt once with: "I didn't catch the URL — please paste your platform address (it should look like `https://your-org.42crunch.cloud`)." If still empty, stop with: "I wasn't able to capture your platform URL. Your binary is installed — run `42crunch-setup` again whenever you have the details ready." |
| User provides empty Freemium Token | Re-prompt once with: "The token didn't come through — please paste it again. You can find it in the registration confirmation email you received" If still empty, stop with: "I wasn't able to capture your Freemium token. Your binary is installed — run `42crunch-setup` again whenever you have the token ready." |
| Cannot write to credentials file | Report the permission error. On macOS/Linux, suggest `chmod u+w ~/.42crunch/conf/env` or creating `~/.42crunch/conf` manually. On Windows, suggest verifying write access to `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf` and creating the folder manually if needed. |
