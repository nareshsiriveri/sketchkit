# validate.sh — Validate the built Grok distribution before publishing.
#
# Grok has no published JSON Schema. We always run structural checks (the two
# manifests are valid JSON and the marketplace catalog is present), and when the
# `grok` CLI is available we additionally run its native `grok plugin validate`.
# The deploy CI now provisions the grok CLI for every build, so the full validate
# (including `grok plugin validate`) runs there as well as in local dev.
#
# Usage: validate.sh <TARGET_DIR>   (a tree produced by build.sh)
