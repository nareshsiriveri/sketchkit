# /mp-review

Audit the current project's Mercado Pago integration. Delegates to the `mp-review` skill, which orchestrates the MCP `quality_checklist` (and `quality_evaluation` when applicable) plus a fixed security floor.

## Behaviour

1. Verify the Mercado Pago MCP is **actually authenticated** by checking that `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__quality_checklist` is callable. The bootstrap tools `authenticate` / `complete_authentication` always exist and prove nothing; `ListMcpResourcesTool` returns "No resources found" either way. If the data tools are not available, call `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__authenticate` to get the authorization URL and show it directly in chat — do not send the user to `/mcp` manually. **There is no offline mode** — the official checklist must come from the MCP.
2. Hand control to the `mp-review` skill, passing `$ARGUMENTS` (the scope) through.

## Scopes

`$ARGUMENTS` (optional) narrows the review:

- `security` — credentials, HTTPS, HMAC, server-side verification, idempotency.
- `webhooks` — defers to `mp-webhooks` for receiver correctness.
- `checkout` / `qr` / `subscriptions` / `marketplace` — product-scoped check.
- `quality` — only the official `quality_checklist` items.
- `full` (default) — everything: security floor + product checks + quality checklist.
