"""Consolidation logic — compress staging files into recent and archive memory.

This is the pipeline stage that runs overnight (or on demand) to merge
daily staging files into the two long-lived memory files:

- **recent.md** — active, high-relevance entries from the last few days.
- **archive.md** — older entries, compressed and deduplicated.

The flow is: shell collects file contents -> this module builds the prompt
and calls Haiku -> Haiku returns a structured response with ``===RECENT===``
and ``===ARCHIVE===`` delimiters -> this module parses and returns the
sections -> shell writes the output files.

Typical usage::

    from pipeline.consolidate import consolidate
    result = consolidate(staging_contents, recent_text, archive_text)
    # result.recent  -> new content for recent.md
    # result.archive -> new content for archive.md
